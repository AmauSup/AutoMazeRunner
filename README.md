Autonomous Maze-Solving Robot with Audio Detection

üß† Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of an autonomous robot capable of navigating and solving a maze using audio sensors to detect walls. The robot employs a 4-wheel drive system and utilizes an audio detection mechanism to sense obstacles, enabling it to make real-time navigation decisions.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components

Arduino Uno: Microcontroller for processing sensor data and controlling motors.

4WD Robot Chassis: Provides mobility for the robot.

L298N Motor Driver: Controls the motors based on signals from the Arduino.

Ultrasonic Sensors (3 units): Measures distances to detect obstacles.

Audio Sensors (Microphone Array): Detects sounds reflecting off walls to aid in navigation.

Servo Motor: Controls the orientation of the audio sensors.

Power Supply: Provides necessary power to all components.

üì¶ Software Requirements

Arduino IDE: Development environment for programming the Arduino.

NewPing Library: Efficient control of ultrasonic sensors.

Servo Library: Controls the servo motor for sensor orientation.

Custom Audio Processing Code: Interprets audio signals for navigation decisions.

üß≠ Navigation Algorithm

The robot employs a combination of ultrasonic and audio sensors to navigate the maze:

Audio Detection: The microphone array detects sounds reflecting off walls, indicating the presence of obstacles.

Sensor Orientation: The servo motor adjusts the orientation of the audio sensors to scan different directions.

Distance Measurement: Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance to obstacles in the robot's path.

Decision Making: Based on sensor inputs, the robot decides to move forward, turn left, or turn right to navigate the maze.
